Welcome! I am Mexican computational biologist at the [Institute of Computational Biomedicine](https://saezlab.org/) in [Uni Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en), Germany.

Why this space?
======
I wanted to find my own corner in the cyberspace where I could share some of my thoughts on working in science, being a first-gen migrant, listening to music or reflecting on cool literature or non-fiction. I somehow believe that the educational system made me believe that I had nothing important to say, and even if that is true, having a public record of my ideas isn't harmful.

Although I am part of the **Academia**, I would say that curiosity and serendipity led me to formal education. I wouldn't consider this as an essential pillar of who I am. On the contrary, the current practices (, the loud voices, the entitlement, and the lack of social sense) of most of mainstream Academia are the main reasons why it is so hard to relate to it. Maybe that's why I am still struggling to commit fully to an academic career, despite enjoying doing research. 

After reading Mark Fisher's (aka [k-punk](https://k-punk.org/)) Capitalist Realism and Ghosts of My Life, I realized that blogging could be a vehicle of ideas and a less strict place to mature them. Expect mainly short-form writings. Music journalism and curation is something that I enjoy doing. I share music mixes and album recommendations. 

What not to expect:
======
For the same reasons above, here I don't mean to represent:

1. Classic science communication (I will write about science, but related to my current work)
2. Opinions of anyone except me. Any writing here does not represent my current academic affiliation, collaborators, or mentors.
