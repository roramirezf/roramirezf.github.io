My current research is focused on combining omics data at multiple scales (bulk, single-cell, and spatial) to understand the cellular organization of tissues and its changes during disease. I am interested in studying how the cellular organization in tissues influences diverse behaviors of individual cells and vice versa. This represents framing the observed transcriptional variability of a given cell type as the consequence of intrinsic signaling mechanisms coupled to local and global tissue responses that require the coordination of multiple cell types. In the context of biomedicine, this perspective allows questioning if distinct etiologies that cause disease (eg. heart failure) lead to similar tissue remodeling processes that associate with convergent cell phenotypes. For the same reason, I have also focused on systemic meta-analyses of distinct patient cohorts and etiologies to provide consensus transcriptional signatures that serve as references for future studies.
